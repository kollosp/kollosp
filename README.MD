## PhD Student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology
Currently, I'm running a machine learning project mainly focused on time-series processing. It is about predicting and optimizing renewable energy sources. The project has the following goals:
* to develop machine learning models that can predict future power generation (time-series prediction);
* to develop control/optimization algorithms for home battery storage systems that cooperate next to RES sources. 

### Recent research outcomes:
* Optimisation of Energy Storage Systems for Purpose to Reduce Energy Cost [link](https://github.com/kollosp/BESSOptimisation/blob/main/Optimisation_of_Energy_Storage_Systems_for_Purpose_to_Reduce_Energy__Cost.pdf),
* Transition Into Solar Elevation Angle Domain for Photovoltaic Power GenerationForecasting [link](https://github.com/kollosp/SunElevationAnglePhotovoltaicForecaster/blob/main/Transition_Into_Solar_Elevation_Angle_Domain_for_Photovoltaic_Power_Generation_Forecasting.pdf),
* On the classification of weather based on the production of photovoltaic installations [link](https://github.com/kollosp/PhotovoltaicBasedCoudinessWeatherClassifier/blob/main/Photovoltaic%20based%20Coudiness%20Weather%20Classifier.pdf)

### Developed Machine learning models:
* PV power prediction model: Sun Elevation angle Photovoltaic Forecaster SEPF.
* Whether classifier on pv power trajectory data: Photovoltaic based Coudiness Weather Classifier PCWC.
