## PhD Student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology
Currently, I am involved in a machine learning project mainly focused on predicting and optimizing renewable energy sources. The project has the following goals:
* to develop machine learning models that can predict future power generation (time-series prediction);
* to develop control/optimization algorithms for home battery storage systems that cooperate next to RES sources. 


### Recently finished research in this area:
* 
*

### Developed Machine learning models:
* PV predictor Sun Elevation angle Photovoltaic forecaster [SEPF]()
* whether classifier Photovoltaic based Coudiness Weather Classifier [PCWC]()


## Formerly Web Developer
During my first and second degrees, I worked as a freelancer. I used the following web technologies:
* Node.js 
* Vue.js
* Apache server
