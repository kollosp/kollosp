## PhD Student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology
Currently, I'm running a machine learning project mainly focused on time-series processing. It is about predicting and optimizing renewable energy sources. The project has the following goals:
* to develop machine learning models that can predict future power generation (time-series prediction);
* to develop control/optimization algorithms for home battery storage systems that cooperate next to RES sources. 


### Recently finished research in this area:
* 
*

### Developed Machine learning models:
* PV power prediction model: Sun Elevation angle Photovoltaic Forecaster [SEPF]()
* Whether classifier on pv power trajectory data: Photovoltaic based Coudiness Weather Classifier [PCWC]()
